    <h1>Mozzarella Basil Pizza</h1>
    <p>
        This is an odin project on a recipe about my 
        <strong>favorite</strong> food. I've chosen
        pizza, but I'm not <em>100%</em> certain.
        It's hard to choose out of all the yummy foods
        in the world! 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8-ounce) ball Pizza Dough</li>
            <li>½ cup Pizza Sauce</li>
            <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced </li>
            <li>12 fresh basil leaves </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Place Pizza Dough on a large sheet of parchment paper. Cover with a damp towel; let rise in a warm place (85°), free from drafts, 45 minutes.
            </li></p>
            <p><li>Preheat oven to 500°.
            </li></p>
            <p><li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle on parchment paper. Crimp edges of dough to form a 1/2-inch border. Slide dough and parchment paper onto a large baking sheet. Place on bottom rack in oven. Bake at 500° for 5 minutes.
            </li></p>
            <p><li>Spread Pizza Sauce evenly onto crust, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Top with cheese slices. Bake an additional 10 minutes or until crust is golden and cheese melts. Remove from oven; let stand 5 minutes. Top with basil leaves; cut into wedges.
            </li></p>
            <p><li>Note: If using refrigerated Pizza Dough, let dough rise as directed in step 1 for 1 hour. Proceed as directed in recipe.
