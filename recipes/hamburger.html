        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Hamburgers are <em>the</em> iconic North American
            foods whenever anyone thinks of "America". Proteins,
            carbs, veggies and dairy all in one. It's actually a 
            healthy super food!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>1 large egg</ul>
            <ul>½ teaspoon salt</ul>
            <ul>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</ul>
            <ul>1 pound ground beef</ul>
            <ul>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p><ol> Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. </ol></p>
            <p><ol> Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. </ol></p>
            <p><ol> Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). </ol></p>
